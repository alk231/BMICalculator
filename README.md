# BMI Calculator

A simple, lightweight web application to calculate Body Mass Index (BMI) using vanilla JavaScript.

## 🚀 About The Project

This is a straightforward tool designed to help users quickly check their BMI. You simply enter your height and weight, and it calculates the score instantly. I built this to practice DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**: For the structure
- **CSS3**: For styling
- **JavaScript**: For the calculation logic and validation

## ✨ Features

- **Instant Calculation**: Calculates BMI immediately upon form submission.
- **Input Validation**: Checks for valid height and weight inputs (prevents negative values or empty fields).
- **Weight Guide**: Displays a quick reference guide for BMI categories (Underweight, Normal, Overweight).
